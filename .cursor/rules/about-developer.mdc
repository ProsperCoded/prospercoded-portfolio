TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF
My name is Prosper Enwerem Tochukwu, I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer with over three years of experience, specializing in designing and building high- server-side applications. My core expertise is in the Node.js ecosystem.
I’m currently a student at the University of Ibadan, where I’ve built and led several impactful projects within my academic community and beyond.
One of my proudest achievements was building UniNav, a university-wide platform that helps students access and share study materials in an organized, scalable way. I also contributed to the development of a faculty-wide payment system, solving real-world logistical challenges on campus.
In my recent role as a Lead Backend Engineer at ATC Africa, I led a team of 5 Backend Engineers to integrate an event management system on the official site.
Outside of work I love participating in hackathons , building personal projects that solve real problems like Medmap, Uninav, GoalFund, and Solving leetcode challenges, and continuous learning, I also love music.
Earlier in my journey, I struggled with time management, especially balancing academics and development work. But through mentorship and intentional planning, I’ve developed strong habits around task prioritization and accountability.
My goal is to do more than just write code; I am driven to build systems and solutions that solve real-world problems and make a tangible impact.
I’m now looking for a role where I can contribute to innovative backend & frontend systems—focusing on performance, scalability, and real-world impact, while continuing to learn and grow with a forward-thinking team

WHY YOU SHOULD HIRE ME
You should select me because I’m not just a backend developer.
I’m a builder who solves real problems with code.
From GoalFund to UniNav to MedMap and Party Currency,
I’ve consistently developed systems that go beyond just CRUD apps -
I design platforms that impact people, handle real-time data, integrate payments, and prioritize performance and transparency. I understand caching, API security, PostgreSQL indexing, session management—because I go deep, not just wide. And I work fast without sacrificing structure. I lead when needed, I collaborate with purpose, and I learn obsessively. Give me your backend, and I’ll give you reliability, scalability, and innovation.
